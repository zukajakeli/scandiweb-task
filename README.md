# Hey there

Thanks for spending your time and reviewing my code.

It was my first touch with class components and was a bit challanging and interesting
as well. I have always worked with functional components and wanted to dive deep into
classes, so this task gave me the opportunity :)

## As for the Application

1. App saves cart products on refresh, and the same cart products with same
   selected attributes will be present.

2. Error message pops up, when adding item to cart from PDP without selecting attribute.

3. If you add item to cart directly from PLP, attributes will be selected by default.

4. Also attributes can be changed from cart and minicart.

### Hope you enjoy my code :) Have a great day

# Sincerely, Zuka Jakeli
